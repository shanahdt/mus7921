                    To Foreigners.

     It was for so long time since I thought myself to
restore the value of Japanese music in general, which was
trusted by a great many foreigners who recognized that it is
nothing else but a mere melody.

     In the meantime, the success attending the introduction
of foreign musics into this country and their rapidly increa-
sing popularity has created a demand for a book of instruction
which should serve as a guide to foreigners of developing
the true beauties of Japanese music.

     I shall be therefore much proud, should artists and
learners find through this means, additional light upon an art
which has been the honor and joy of our life.

                      Preface.

                -------==***==-------

     The work of Japanese Popular Music to a
class of both foreign and Japanese amateurs
is doubtless a new type to many into whose hands this
book may fall.

     All the Musics in this book have been so atten-
tively edited by Mr. Y. Nagai, the Military Band-master,
and arranged by Mr. K. Kobatake, renowned
saxaphone player in Japan, that the most of which, of
course have not heretofore appeared in any other
works.  The experience of those who have undertaken
them, proves that they are entirely and invaluable
and ne plus ultra collection, ever since some of the
kinds have been offered to the Musical World.

     The author has also given in this volume a great
prize to all who study faithfully its technical difficul-
ties, which, when once conquered, natural talent beco-
mes free, takes wing and may arrive as high as genius
can reach.

     As for those who wish to acquire what is to be
played in Japanese social circles, this book will by any
means suit to them, to whom our desire is this that, if
great economy would render and long-felt requirement
might meet, we trust, the extent of these distributions,
should more or less enabled them to study with advan-
tage the charming and melodious etudes.

     We here tender our acknowledgments for the
valuable assistance of Mr. W. C. Sakai, and of Mr.
J. Inowye.
