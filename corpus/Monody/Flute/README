   Welcome to FluteStudy, a database of Royal Conservatory
               of Music graded Flute studies.

           All studies were encoded by Joy Ollen.

	The purpose of this project is to provide a sample of
test pieces for a program capable of estimating the technical
performance difficulty of flute repertoire.  In order to test
the reliability of the program, it is useful to have a body
of independently-graded repertoire available.

	All studies in the database were selected from the
Royal Conservatory of Music Flute Syllabus.  This is a national
teaching curriculum used in Canada for private study and is
over one hundred years old.  The flute curriculum is listed
in the syllabus for grades 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 and an Associate
Certificate level.  Studies are required for all but the last.

	The studies included in the database were randomly
selected by the rolling of a die for each grade level.  A
shortlist from which studies were selected from each grade was
prepared based upon score availability.

	Two of the studies, andersen15,12 and TG2,5, use
the metronome markings indicated in the scores.  The rest of 
the studies did not give any metronome markings and so an 
experienced flute performer/teacher was consulted to suggest 
appropriate markings for the grade level.  Those markings have 
been included.

	The studies have been encoded using **kern and include
information on pitch, duration, articulation, and breath
markings.

	A **dynam spine includes dynamics.  In encoding
the dynamic markings some rationalization was necessary and
interpreted dynamic markings not found in the score have been
preceded by X.
