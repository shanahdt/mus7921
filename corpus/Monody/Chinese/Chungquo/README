NOTE ON THE 30 CHINESE FOLK SONGS
by Paul von Hippel
Wednesday, October 14, 1998

The 30 Chinese folk songs in this directory were encoded by David Huron at
a time when the Humdrum format was not as standardized as it is today. On
September 30, 1998, Paul von Hippel revised the encodings to conform
to modern Humdrum conventions. Von Hippel's revisions are described in
the editorial modification records ("!!!EMD") at the end of each file.
The current version of the collection is 2.0.

The encodings comprise the first 30 monophonic tunes from a printed
collection of Chinese folk songs (Chung-kuo yin yueh yen chiu so, 1959).
Specifically, the encodings comprise that volume's folk songs numbers
1-18 and 20-31. Song number 19, which is not monophonic, was skipped in
the encoding process.

When a collection is represented by a non-random sample, as this one is,
there is a danger that the sampled songs will share some quality that
is not characteristic of the collection as a whole. For example, if the
first 31 songs in the collection were all from a particular province of
China, the sample would be biased toward that province -- although the
collection as a whole might represent all provinces equally. Fortunately,
a cursory inspection of the printed source does not suggest that the
songs were ordered by category. If the sampling process introduced any
biases, those biases were not immediately obvious.

The updated encodings include two unusual features. First, all repeated
sections in these encodings are written out in full. There is no need
to expand the encodings using Humdrum's thru command.

Second, in addition to the standard Humdrum reference records, these
encodings include records beginning "!!!PPG" to indicate the page number
on which each song began in the printed source.
