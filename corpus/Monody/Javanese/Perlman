Dear David,
  Great to talk to you today, as always.  Here's a sample Javanese
composition, with a key to the notation, and some of the questions I'd like
answered.  Let me know if I've failed to make this clear enough.

Thanks and all the best,
Marc

= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

Tones of the scale, from low to high:
Pelog:
1_ 2_ 3_ 4_ 5_ 6_ 7_  1 2 3 4 5 6 7  1^ 2^ 3^ 4^

Slendro:
2_ 3_ 5_ 6_  1 2 3 5 6  1^ 2^ 3^

(Tones given the same numeral belong to the same pitch-class.  I use the
underscore to indicate lower octave, caret for upper octave; a bare numeral
is middle octave.)

A period indicates that the preceeding tone is sustained.

One numeral or period occupies one beat (fractions of beats, which are
fairly rare, will have to be indicated somehow or other).

The smallest metric units are 4-beat groups called _gatra_.  They are
indicated by the spacing.  The rightmost numeral or period in a group
receives metric stress.

The following symbols represent strokes on the structure-defining instruments:

Right parenthesis = kenong
Left parenthesis  = gong (always accompanied by kenong)

In this piece, each _kenongan_ (phrase ending with a kenong-stroke)
consists of four _gatra_ (4-beat units).  There are four _kenongan_ in a
_gongan_ (space between successive gong-strokes).

"Gendhing" is a general term for formal structure.

"Titipati" is the composition's proper name.

"Kethuk 2 kerep minggah 4" describes the form of the piece ("kethuk 2
kerep" describes the first movement; "minggah 4" describes the second
movement).

The designation "slendro" (for tuning system) affects the interpretation of
the numerals.  For instance, in this tuning system there are no 4's or 7's;
the interval between 3 and 5 is a step, not a skip.

"Nem" is the mode (pathet) of the piece.

"Buka": This is the introduction.  It is played once and never repeated.

"Merong": The first movement.  It has four gongan.  It can be repeated
(theoretically without limit, but usually only once).  The repeated section
is indicated by the "|" brackets.  To move to the next movement, leave the
merong at the $ and go to the umpak.

"Umpak": A transitional phrase, never repeated.

"Inggah": The second movement, repeatable.  Here it consists of two gongan.
The repetition takes place between "|" signs.

Notice that the first and third positions of each _gatra_ in the inggah
section are always periods.  This is a melodic idiom called "balungan
nibani," and there are really only two positions within each _gatra_ (the
second and fourth positions are always filled with numerals, never with
periods, in this idiom).

= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

Here are some of the questions I'd like to ask:

Which tones appear at kenong-strokes?  At gong-strokes?  At the ends of
_gatra_s?  Tabulate them.

How many different _gatra_s are used in the repertory?

How many different _gatra_ contours are used in the repertory?  (A _gatra_
contour is a class of _gatra_s which are identical under transposition.)

NB. A footnote:
Defining identity under transposition is tricky, since it depends on the
tuning system.  In slendro these are all equivalent contours:

2321
3532
5653
61^65
1^2^1^6

In pelog, the tones 4 and 7 function as exchange tones in certain modes.
For example, in pelog lima, 4 replaces 3 in certain phrases.  So these
_gatra_ would all have the same contour:

2321
2421
3532
4542
5653
5654
etc.

In pelog barang (which uses 7 instead of 1), 4 replaces 5.  So these
_gatra_ would all have the same contour:

2327
3532
3432
5653
6765
72^76

End of footnote.

Are there more rare gatras or gatra contours in pelog than slendro?

Which compositions have gatras or gatra contours that appear in no other
composition?

Tabulate the use of intervals between successive notes.  Are skips more
likely to occur between the first and second notes of a _gatra_, or the
second and third, the third and fourth, or the fourth and the first (of the
next _gatra_)?  Present statistics for each interval and each position
within the _gatra_.

(Note that in balungan nibani, there are only two positions within a
_gatra_, not four.)

Are there any _gatra_ that occur much more frequently at one pitch level
than at the pitch an octave higher or lower?

For each two-_gatra_ phrase in this composition, list all of the
compositions that also use that phrase.  (Similarly for each four-_gatra_
phrase.)
