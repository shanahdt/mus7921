Dear David,
  Wow--talk about quick service!  That's astounding.  I am very impressed!

I will sit down with the results in a little while, but right off the bat I
notice some potential trouble spots.

First, collapsing pitch into pitch class makes the results mostly
impossible to interpret.  Will it be tricky to get Humdrum to deal with
pitch rather than pitch class?

Second, the distinction between balungan nibani and regular balungan is
crucial.  In balungan nibani, there are only two melodic events per gatra.
Perhaps this is really a question of the interpretation of notated periods
(sustains; i.e., "tied" notes).  For example, these are all valid gatra:

End of
Previous
Gatra        Gatra

2            .6.5
2            .5.3
2            .3.1
6            .5.3
6            .3.5
3            .6.5

These, however, are not valid shapes:

>            2665
>            2553
>            2331
>            1332
>            6553
>            6335
>            3665

... even though that's what you get if you "fill in the dots."

In particular, it's important to be able to distinguish between:

2            .3.1

and:

[any note]   23.1

... both of which will turn into 2331 once the periods are filled in.  In
other words, I need to be able to analyze at two levels: (1) the "ties" are
ignored, so for example three consecutive occurrances of the pitch 6, all
tied together, would count the same as three repeated 6's; (2) the "ties"
are recognized, so that 6.. could be distinguished from 666.


>>Are there any _gatra_ that occur much more frequently at one pitch level
>>than at the pitch an octave higher or lower?
>
>Do you want exact octave transpositions or any transposition?

This question is the one that, more than any other, I need answered.  But
it can't be answered by collapsing pitch into pitch-class.  I want to
compare the number of occurrences of each gatra with the number of
occurrences of the same contour an octave higher or lower.  For example,
how many times does 6_ 5_ 3_ 5_ appear, compared to how many times 6 5 3 5
appears?  So the ability to analyze in terms of pitch (rather than just
pitch class) will be crucial for me.

Humdrum looks so prodigiously powerful that I desperately hope it will be
able to solve these little problems!

Thanks for taking the time to do this ... I really am more grateful than I
can say!  I first tried to build my own analysis tools eleven years ago, so
Humdrum looks like the answer to a very old dream of mine!

All the best,
Marc
