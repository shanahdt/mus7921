NOTE ON THE 24 AFRICAN SONGS
by Paul von Hippel
Tuesday, September 29, 1998

The songs in this directory were encoded by David Huron at a time when the
Humdrum format was not as standardized as it is today. On September 29,
1998, Paul von Hippel revised encodings to conform to modern Humdrum
conventions. Von Hippel's revisions are described in the editorial
modification records ("!!!EMD") at the end of each file. The current
version of the collection is Version 2.0.

The encodings comprise all 24 of the songs in Makeba's (1971) collection.
The represented ethnic groups are sub-Saharan. 18 of the songs are Xhosa,
4 are Zulu, 1 is Pondo, and 1 is Venda.  In addition to the standard
Humdrum reference records, these transcriptions include records beginning
"!!!PPG" to indicate the page number on which each song began in the
printed source.

Makeba's volume is a popular, rather than a scholarly work; its editors
acknowledge that "precise accuracy in transcription has sometimes had
to give way to playability" (p. 25). The editors also suggest piano and
guitar accompaniments.

Two comments are especially pertinent to users carrying out
analyses. First, one of the encoded melodies (xhosa02.krn) is not
proper monophony. In the printed source, this melody is harmonized by
two accompanying vocal lines.

Second, all repeated sections in these encodings are written out in
full. There is no need to expand the encodings using Humdrum's thru
command.
