NOTES:
======

The autograph for Part I of the WTC bears the date 1722.  However, it
is likely that many of the individual movements were written some time
earlier.  The fugue in A minor has been characterized as awkwardly written
and archaic in style, and so is especially likely to date from an early
period in Bach's life.  The majority of movements in Part II date from a
much later period.  Various stylistic changes are evident, including a
more marked penchant to write in three voices.

======================
OSSIA AND SIC VERSIONS
======================

There are many variations evident in the extant sources for the Well-
Tempered Clavier.  In this edition, only the major variants have been made
available.  For 17 of the enclosed fugues, alternative or "ossia" versions
are available.  The standard ("sic") version may be accessed by typing the
following command:

     strophe -x sic <filename>  > newfilename.sic

An "ossia" version can be generated by typing:

     strophe -x ossia <filename>  > newfilename.ossia

The following files encode BOTH ossia and sic versions:

     wtc1f01.krn      wtc1f12.krn      wtc1f18.krn
     wtc1f19.krn      wtc1f20.krn      wtc2f02.krn
     wtc2f03.krn      wtc2f05.krn      wtc2f06.krn
     wtc2f08.krn      wtc2f10.krn      wtc2f12.krn
     wtc2f15.krn      wtc2f16.krn      wtc2f17.krn
     wtc2f20.krn      wtc2f21.krn

Either "ossia" or "sic" versions can be generated automatically for
ALL of these files by executing the enclosed command "ready".  In
order to generate all of the "sic" versions simply type:

     ready sic

Simiarly, you can generate "ossia" versions by typing:

     ready ossia
