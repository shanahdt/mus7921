            `Six concertos with several instruments, dedicated
             to His Royal Highness Christian Ludwig,  Margrave
             of Brandenburg, etc. etc.  by His very humble and
             most  obedient servant,  Johann  Sebastian  Bach.'


This electronic edition of Bach's six Brandenburg Concertos has been
produced by the Center for Computer Assisted Research in the Humanities.
The accompanying files were prepared from the Bach-Gesellschaft edition
of 1871, edited by Wilhelm Rust, and published in Leipzig.

Machine transcription, proof reading, and proof listening was done by
Frances Bennion, Edmund Correia, Jr., and Steven Rasmussen, under the
supervision of Dr. Eleanor Selfridge-Field.  Translation to the Humdrum
**kern format was carried out by Dr. David Huron.  Music entry and
editing was done using the "Tenx" facilities designed and implemented
by Dr. Walter Hewlett.  This electronic edition is also available in the
MIDI format.  (See below for ordering information.)

The accompanying files are protected by copyright and are distributed by
license only.  Refer to the accompanying license statement and original

CHECKSUMS:
==========

     A "checksum" value is an error-checking mechanism that may assist
     in determining whether a file has been modified or data garbled
     due to transmission or faulty storage.  The "checksum A" value
     uses the POSIX.2 checksum algorithm.  The "checksum B" value uses
     the CCITT cyclic redundancy check algorithm.  Note that checksum
     commands differ from system to system.  The above checksums were
     calculated for DOS-format data.
